It has a client that registers mobile numbers, sends SMS messages to them and then fetches answers that are returned by registered users. It took about a year from the starting point but most of this time was spent on unsuccessful tries on making a library for communication with a modem using Python language of programming. The actual  development time of the client took about 3 months of after-school work and the website was created in about the same time.
